# Complete Solution: Accessing All 150+ Municipal Documents
## Bypassing PowerBI Limitations for Full Transparency

## Problem Statement

The citizens of Carmen de Areco face significant challenges in accessing municipal financial information:

1. **Limited Document Access**: Only ~50 documents were easily accessible through the official portal
2. **Hidden Information**: An estimated 150+ municipal documents exist but are difficult to find
3. **PowerBI Restrictions**: Financial data is locked behind PowerBI with access limitations
