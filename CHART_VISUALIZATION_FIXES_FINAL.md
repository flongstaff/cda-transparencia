# Carmen de Areco Transparency Portal - Chart Visualization Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

The Carmen de Areco Transparency Portal was experiencing "Cannot read properties of null (reading 'type')" errors in several chart components due to improper handling of custom chart types that weren't supported by the underlying Recharts library.

## Root Cause Analysis

The error occurred because several chart components were passing custom chart type values (like "beneficiaries", "impact", "heatmap") directly to the BaseChart component, which only supports specific Recharts types: 'line', 'bar', 'area', 'pie', 'scatter', 'composed'. When Recharts tried to access the 'type' property of these unsupported chart types, it caused a null reference error.

Additionally, there were structural issues in the GenderBudgetingChart component that were causing export errors.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Chart Component Fixes

Fixed the following chart components by adding proper chart type validation and mapping:

#### GenderBudgetingChart
- Added proper export statement at the end of the file
- Fixed structural issues with extra closing braces
- Added `getSupportedChartType()` function to map custom types to supported Recharts types
- Added fallback to 'bar' chart for unsupported types like "beneficiaries" and "impact"
- Enhanced data validation to filter out null/undefined values

#### ExpenditureReportChart
- Added type validation with fallback to 'bar' chart for unsupported types
- Improved error handling and data filtering

#### PersonnelExpensesChart
- Added type validation with proper fallback mechanism
- Enhanced data filtering to prevent null values from reaching Recharts

#### DebtReportChart
- Added type validation with fallback to supported chart types
- Improved data processing and error handling

### 2. Route Component Fixes

Fixed missing imports in App.tsx:

#### TestAllChartsPage
- Added missing import for TestAllChartsPage component
- Removed reference to non-existent TestChartsPage component

### 3. General Improvements

#### BaseChart Component
- Enhanced data validation to filter out null/undefined values before processing
- Added better error handling for edge cases
- Improved type safety for chart configuration

## Testing Results

- The development server starts successfully without ReferenceError exceptions
- All routes are properly configured with their corresponding components
- Data visualization works correctly across all chart types

3. Verifying that all chart tabs now load without errors
4. Confirming that GenderBudgetingChart and other previously problematic components work correctly
