# Document Data Service Implementation Summary

## Overview
This implementation enhances the Carmen de Areco Transparency Portal by improving how data is organized and fetched from local Markdown and JSON files. The solution addresses the issue where the system was failing to correctly understand what data belongs to each year and how to display it properly on each page/site/category.

## Key Components

### 1. DocumentDataService (`frontend/src/services/DocumentDataService.ts`)
- Created a new service that organizes data by year and category
- Reads from the organized document inventory (`document_inventory.json`)
- Implements caching for improved performance
- Provides methods to fetch:
  - Available years
  - Categories for a specific year
  - Documents for a specific year and category
  - Yearly data organized by category
  - Individual documents by path
  - Document search functionality

### 2. Enhanced Data Fetching (`frontend/src/hooks/useTransparencyData.ts`)
- Updated the transparency data hook to use the new DocumentDataService as a fallback
- Added better error handling and logging
- Improved data transformation to ensure consistent formatting

### 3. Frontend Integration
- Modified existing components to properly utilize the new data organization
- Ensured data is displayed correctly by year and category
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing API endpoints

## Implementation Details

### Data Organization
The service now properly organizes documents by:
- **Year**: Extracted from document metadata
- **Category**: Normalized category names (e.g., "Documentos_Generales" becomes "Documentos Generales")
- **Type**: Document type classification

### Caching Strategy
- Implemented in-memory caching with configurable timeout (5 minutes)
- Cache keys are generated based on query parameters
- Automatic cache invalidation to ensure fresh data

### Fallback Mechanisms
- Primary data source: API endpoints (when available)
- Secondary: Local JSON files (`data_index_{year}.json`)
- Tertiary: DocumentDataService reading from organized document inventory
- Quaternary: Hardcoded fallback data for critical components

## Benefits

### Improved Data Accuracy
- Correctly associates documents with their respective years
- Properly categorizes documents for accurate display
- Eliminates data mismatch issues

### Better Performance
- Caching reduces redundant network requests
- Parallel data fetching for multiple categories
- Efficient data transformation and normalization

### Enhanced User Experience
- Faster page loads due to optimized data fetching
- More accurate data representation by year/category
- Better error handling with graceful degradation

### Maintainability
- Modular service architecture
- Clear separation of concerns
- Extensible design for future enhancements

## Testing
Created comprehensive test files:
- `frontend/public/test-document-service.html` - Interactive test page
- `frontend/src/services/test-document-data.ts` - Automated test script

## Deployment
All changes have been:
- Committed to the repository
- Pushed to GitHub
- Integrated with existing CI/CD pipeline

## Future Improvements
1. Enhance search functionality with full-text search capabilities
2. Implement pagination for large document sets
3. Add data visualization components for budget execution data
4. Integrate with backend API for real-time data updates
5. Implement offline support for mobile users
