## 🏗️ Enhanced Architecture Implementation

### Data Sources Integration
- **External APIs** (Primary): Government transparency portals, datos.gob.ar, etc.
- **Local Files** (Secondary): CSV/JSON files in repository via GitHub raw URLs
- **PDF Data** (Processed): OCR-extracted data from official documents
- **Generated Data** (Fallback): Synthetic data when other sources unavailable
