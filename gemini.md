This review should help in verifying that the correct information is displayed with the appropriate visualizations.

## Suggestions for Improvement

### 1. Expand Data Sources

The project currently relies on data from the Carmen de Areco municipal website and other official sources. To provide a more comprehensive view, consider integrating data from:

*   **National and Provincial APIs**: The `docs/DATA_SOURCES.md` file lists several national and provincial APIs. Prioritize integrating data from:
    *   **API de Presupuesto Abierto**: To compare local data with national trends.
    *   **API Contrataciones Abiertas**: To cross-reference local contract data with the national system.
    *   **Provincial Transparency Portal**: To get more detailed data on provincial transfers.
*   **Civil Society Organizations**: Data from organizations like CIPPEC and Directorio Legislativo can provide valuable context and analysis.
*   **Nearby Municipalities**: The `docs/DATA_SOURCES.md` file lists several nearby municipalities. Adding their data would allow for comparative analysis and benchmarking.

### 2. Enhance Visualizations and Interactivity

The current set of charts is a good starting point. To make the data even more accessible, consider:

*   **Interactive Maps**: Use the **API Georef Argentina** to create interactive maps showing the location of public works, municipal properties, and other geographically relevant data.
*   **Network Graphs**: For contract data, use network graphs to visualize the relationships between companies, public officials, and public contracts. This can help identify potential conflicts of interest.
*   **More Granular Filters**: Allow users to filter data by quarter, month, or even specific keywords.
*   **Data Export**: Allow users to download the data in CSV or JSON format for their own analysis.

### 3. Improve Data Integrity and Verification

The project already has a `DataValidationService.ts`, which is great. To further improve data integrity:

*   **Automated Verification**: Implement automated scripts to cross-reference data from different sources. For example, compare the total amount of contracts in the municipal data with the data from the national procurement system.
*   **Public Verification**: Allow users to flag potential errors or inconsistencies in the data. This can help identify data quality issues and build community trust.
*   **Blockchain for Document Integrity**: For critical documents like budget ordinances, consider using a blockchain to store a hash of the document. This would provide a tamper-proof way to verify the document's integrity. The `docs/DATA_SOURCES.md` file mentions **Blockchain Federal Argentina**.

### 4. Enhance User Experience (UX)

*   **Data Stories**: Instead of just presenting raw data and charts, create "data stories" that guide users through the data and explain the key findings. For example, a data story could explain the budget process from start to finish, with visualizations at each step.
*   **Simplified Language**: Avoid jargon and use clear, simple language to explain the data.
*   **Mobile-First Design**: Ensure the platform is fully responsive and easy to use on mobile devices.

### 5. Code and Architecture

*   **Component Library**: The project has a good set of reusable components. Consider documenting them in a tool like Storybook to make them easier to maintain and reuse.
*   **API Documentation**: The backend API should be well-documented using a standard like OpenAPI (Swagger). This will make it easier for other developers to understand and use the API.
*   **Testing**: The project has some tests, but it's important to have a comprehensive test suite that covers all the key functionality. This will help ensure the quality of the code and prevent regressions.
