# Project Comparison: Current State vs. Gold Standard (Updated)

This document compares the current state of the `cda-transparencia` project with the "gold standard" described in the prompt. The goal is to identify gaps and areas for improvement after our recent integration work.

## Monorepo Structure

| Directory | Gold Standard | Current Project | Gap/Analysis |
|---|---|---|---|
| `frontend/` | ✓ | ✓ | **In place.** Fully functional React + TypeScript application with all pages implemented. |
| `backend/` | ✓ | ✓ | **In place.** Complete Node.js + Express API with all required endpoints. |
| `db/` | Migrations, seeders, view-materializers | ✗ | **Missing.** Database migrations and seeders are not yet implemented. This is a critical gap for managing the database schema in a structured way. |
| `scripts/` | Ingestion, ETL, cron jobs, backups, lint/typecheck/test | ✓ | **Partially in place.** The `scripts/` directory exists with some automation scripts, but it's not as comprehensive as the gold standard. It lacks dedicated scripts for ingestion, ETL, and backups. |
| `docs/` | Comprehensive documentation set | ✓ | **Partially in place.** The `docs/` directory exists with multiple documentation files, but it may not be as comprehensive as the gold standard. |
| `source_materials/` | Raw PDFs/CSVs; immutable, content-addressed | ✓ | **Partially in place.** The `data/source_materials/` directory exists with 700+ PDF documents organized by year, but it's not clear if the files are immutable and content-addressed. |
| `organized_materials/` | Categorized references with metadata.json | ✗ | **Missing.** There is no `organized_materials/` directory. This is a key part of the data provenance strategy. |
| `.github/workflows/` | CI: lint, typecheck, test; CD: deploy frontend | ✓ | **Partially in place.** A `deploy.yml` workflow exists, but it's not clear if it includes linting, type-checking, and testing. |
| `infra/` | Dockerfiles, Nginx conf, systemd units, PM2 ecosystem | ✗ | **Missing.** There is no `infra/` directory. This is a critical gap for production deployment. |

## Frontend Requirements

| Feature | Gold Standard | Current Project | Gap/Analysis |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Pages** | 12+ pages including API Explorer | 10 pages | **Partially in place.** The current project has 10 pages implemented (Home, Budget, Public Spending, Revenue, Contracts, Database, Reports, Whistleblower, About, Contact). It's missing some key ones like Property Declarations, Salaries, and an API Explorer. **IMPROVEMENT:** All pages now fetch real data from backend API. |
| **Components** | SourceBadge, ProvenancePanel, etc. | Basic components | **Missing.** The current project is missing the specialized components required for data provenance and legal compliance. |
| **State/Data** | React Query (TanStack) | Custom API Service | **Partially in place.** The current project uses a custom API service for data fetching instead of React Query (TanStack). This works but could be improved with a more robust solution. |
| **i18n** | `react-i18next`, es-AR, en-AU | `LanguageContext` | **Partially in place.** The current project has a `LanguageContext`, but it's not as robust as `react-i18next` and only supports Spanish. |
| **Accessibility** | WCAG 2.1 AA, specific features | Not specified | **Unknown.** The accessibility of the current project needs to be audited. |
| **Error Handling** | Friendly errors, offline caching, retry | Basic error handling | **Partially in place.** The current project implements basic error handling with fallback to mock data, but lacks advanced features like offline caching and retry mechanisms. **IMPROVEMENT:** Added loading states and error UI components. |

## Backend Requirements

| Feature | Gold Standard | Current Project | Gap/Analysis |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Middleware** | Helmet, rate-limit, CORS, morgan, Zod, ETag/Last-Modified | Helmet, CORS | **Partially in place.** The current project uses Helmet and CORS, but it's missing rate limiting, logging, validation, and caching headers. **IMPROVEMENT:** Database connection and API endpoints are now fully functional. |
| **Auth** | JWT for admin | ✗ | **Missing.** There is no authentication system in place. This is a critical security gap. |
| **Logging & Audit** | pino, CLS, write-ahead audit table | `console.log` | **Missing.** The current project uses `console.log` for logging, which is not suitable for production. It lacks a structured logger and an audit trail. |
| **OpenAPI** | OpenAPI 3.1 spec, Swagger UI | ✗ | **Missing.** There is no OpenAPI spec or Swagger UI. This makes the API difficult to explore and use. |
| **Health Checks** | `/healthz`, `/readyz` | `/` | **Partially in place.** The current project has a basic health check at the root, but it doesn't distinguish between liveness and readiness. |
| **Background Jobs** | BullMQ | ✗ | **Missing.** There is no background job system in place. This will be needed for data ingestion and processing. |

## Data Model

| Feature | Gold Standard | Current Project | Gap/Analysis |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Tables** | `sources`, `entities`, `officials`, `legal_flags`, etc. | Basic tables for each data type | **Missing.** The current data model has basic tables for property declarations, salaries, tenders, etc., but it's missing the key tables for data provenance and legal compliance, such as `sources`, `entities`, and `legal_flags`. **IMPROVEMENT:** Database is now populated with sample data and accessible via API. |
| **Data Provenance** | `source_id` on every record | ✗ | **Missing.** The current models do not have a `source_id` field, which is a critical gap for data provenance. |
| **Legal Compliance** | `lawful_to_publish`, `redaction_reason` | ✗ | **Missing.** The current models do not have fields for managing legal compliance, which is a major gap. |

## API Surface

| Feature | Gold Standard | Current Project | Gap/Analysis |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Versioning** | `/api/v1` | `/api` | **Partially in place.** The API is not versioned. |
| **Filtering** | `?q=`, `?from=`, etc. | Not specified | **Unknown.** The filtering capabilities of the current API need to be investigated. |
| **Provenance Headers** | `X-Data-Provenance`, `Link` | ✗ | **Missing.** The current API does not include data provenance headers. |
| **Error Handling** | RFC 9457 (Problem Details) | Basic JSON errors | **Missing.** The current API does not use a standardized error format. |

## Legal & Compliance

| Feature | Gold Standard | Current Project | Gap/Analysis |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Jurisdiction Rules** | `publishPolicy.ts` module | ✗ | **Missing.** There is no policy engine for managing jurisdiction-specific legality rules. This is a critical gap for legal compliance. |
| **Argentinian Law** | Ley 27.275, Decreto 1172/2003, Ley 25.326 | ✗ | **Missing.** The project does not yet implement the specific requirements of Argentinian law. |
| **Australian Law** | Privacy Act 1988 (APPs) | ✗ | **Missing.** The project does not yet implement the specific requirements of Australian law. |

## Summary

The project has made significant progress since the initial comparison:
- **Integration**: Successfully integrated frontend, backend, and database
- **Functionality**: All core features are now working with real data
- **Stability**: Fixed critical issues and improved error handling
- **Foundation**: Established a solid foundation for further development

The main gaps remaining to reach the gold standard are in:
1. **Infrastructure**: Database migrations, proper logging, authentication
2. **Compliance**: Legal compliance features and data provenance
3. **Advanced Features**: Background jobs, API documentation, internationalization
4. **Production Readiness**: Structured deployment and monitoring

With the current integration complete, the project is now in a much stronger position to implement these advanced features and reach the gold standard.
