## Known Issues
⚠️ **Client-side routing limitation**: Due to GitHub Pages configuration with custom domains, direct access to sub-pages (e.g., /dashboard, /budget) may not work correctly. This is a common limitation with SPAs hosted on GitHub Pages and can be addressed in future updates by implementing hash-based routing or switching to a different hosting solution.

## Next Steps
1. Implement hash-based routing to resolve client-side routing issues
2. Add more data visualizations and analysis tools
3. Enhance mobile experience with additional optimizations
4. Implement user feedback collection system
5. Add multi-language support
