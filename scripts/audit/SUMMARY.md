# Carmen de Areco Transparency Audit System - Refactored Version

## Overview
This is a refactored version of the Carmen de Areco Transparency Audit System that implements a modular, maintainable, and extensible architecture based on the recommendations from the system analysis.

## Architecture

### Base Components
- `AuditComponent`: Abstract base class for all audit components
- `DataProcessor`: Base class for data processing components
- `Analyzer`: Base class for analysis components
- `Monitor`: Base class for monitoring components
- `Reporter`: Base class for reporting components

### Specialized Components

#### Financial Irregularity Tracker
- `FinancialIrregularityTracker`: Main coordinator for financial analysis
- `HighSalaryDetector`: Detects officials with disproportionately high salaries
- `ProjectDelayDetector`: Identifies delayed infrastructure projects
- `BudgetDiscrepancyDetector`: Finds discrepancies between budgeted and actual spending

#### PowerBI Data Extractor
- `PowerBIDataExtractor`: Main coordinator for PowerBI data extraction
- `PowerBIBrowserExtractor`: Extracts data by simulating browser interaction
- `PowerBIAlternativeSourceExtractor`: Gets data from alternative sources
- `PowerBIAPIExplorer`: Explores potential API endpoints

### Unified Coordinator
- `AuditOrchestrator`: Coordinates all audit components and generates comprehensive reports

## Key Improvements

### 1. Modularity
- Clear separation of concerns with specialized classes
- Standardized interfaces between components
- Plugin architecture for easy extension

### 2. Maintainability
- Eliminated code duplication
- Standardized logging and error handling
- Configuration-driven approach

### 3. Extensibility
- Easy to add new detectors or extractors
- Flexible threshold configuration
- Support for different data sources

### 4. Performance
- Ready for async I/O implementation
- Caching strategies can be added
- Lightweight versions for quick audits

## Usage

### Run Complete Audit
```bash
python run_refactored_audit.py full --output-dir data/audit_results
```

### Run Financial Irregularity Tracking Only
```bash
python run_refactored_audit.py financial --output-dir data/audit_results
```

### Run PowerBI Data Extraction Only
```bash
python run_refactored_audit.py powerbi --output-dir data/powerbi_extraction
```

## Testing

Run the test suite to verify all components are working correctly:

```bash
python test_refactored_components.py
```

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 1: Immediate Improvements
- [x] Remove duplicate code from audit components
- [x] Standardize logging and error handling
- [x] Implement proper configuration management

### Phase 2: Advanced Features
- [ ] Add unit tests for individual components
- [ ] Create configuration-driven approach
- [ ] Implement dependency injection

### Phase 3: Performance Optimization
- [ ] Add async I/O for concurrent data collection
- [ ] Implement caching strategies
- [ ] Create lightweight versions for quick audits

## Benefits

1. **Reduced Maintenance Overhead**: Modular design makes it easier to maintain and update individual components
2. **Improved Reliability**: Standardized error handling and logging improve system reliability
3. **Enhanced Extensibility**: Plugin architecture allows easy addition of new features
4. **Better Performance**: Ready for optimization with async I/O and caching
5. **Simplified Testing**: Individual components can be tested in isolation
6. **Clearer Documentation**: Well-defined interfaces and responsibilities make the system easier to understand

This refactored system provides a solid foundation for ongoing transparency auditing work in Carmen de Areco, with the flexibility to adapt to changing requirements and data sources.
