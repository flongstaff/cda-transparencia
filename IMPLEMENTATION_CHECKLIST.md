## Implementation Tasks - Ordered by Priority

### Phase 1: Vendor Relationship and Conflict of Interest Systems
- [ ] Create VendorRelationshipService.js in backend/src/services/
- [ ] Create ConflictOfInterestService.js in backend/src/services/ 
- [ ] Create VendorRelationshipController.js in backend/src/controllers/
- [ ] Create ConflictOfInterestController.js in backend/src/controllers/ 
- [ ] Create vendor relationship routes
- [ ] Create conflict of interest routes

### Phase 2: Contract Oversight Systems  
- [ ] Create ContractOversightService.js in backend/src/services/
- [ ] Create BiddingThresholdTracker.js in backend/src/services/
- [ ] Create ContractOversightController.js in backend/src/controllers/
- [ ] Create bidding threshold routes
- [ ] Implement approval workflow logic

### Phase 3: Salary Benchmarking and Performance Systems
- [ ] Create SalaryBenchmarkingService.js in backend/src/services/
- [ ] Create ContractorPerformanceDashboardService.js in backend/src/services/  
- [ ] Create ProjectMilestonePaymentService.js in backend/src/services/
- [ ] Create SalaryBenchmarkingController.js in backend/src/controllers/
- [ ] Create ContractorPerformanceDashboardController.js in backend/src/controllers/
- [ ] Create ProjectMilestonePaymentController.js in backend/src/controllers/

### Phase 4: Infrastructure Audit Systems
- [ ] Create InfrastructureAuditService.js in backend/src/services/
- [ ] Create InfrastructureTrackingController.js in backend/src/controllers/ 
- [ ] Create infrastructure audit routes
- [ ] Create related database models if needed

### Phase 5: Data Models and Integration  
- [ ] Add new DB models for VendorRelation, ContractApproval, InfrastructureProject
- [ ] Update database schema as needed

### Phase 6: Frontend Dashboard Integration (If Applicable)
- [ ] Create dashboard components in frontend/src/
- [ ] Update existing dashboard layouts

### Phase 7: Validation and Testing
- [ ] Verify all new services integrate properly with existing system 
- [ ] Test API endpoints for new functionality
- [ ] Validate proper error handling and edge cases

## Implementation Strategy

### 1. Follow Existing Architectural Patterns:
- All services follow same naming conventions and structure as existing services
- Controllers use the same pattern (bind methods, async handling)
- Routes built using similar patterns to existing routes  
- Data models and database integration follow established conventions

### 2. Real Data Integration (No Mocks):
- All services will work with real municipal financial datasets
- No mock data - will use actual JSON files and database structures from the project  
- Integration with existing endpoints for financial data, salary information, procurement records

### 3. Security and Compliance:
- Maintain same security standards as existing services  
- Follow established audit logging protocols for sensitive operations
- Proper input validation and data sanitization

### 4. Documentation and Code Quality:
- Document all new services with proper JSDoc comments
- Follow existing code style and formatting conventions  
- Ensure all new functionality is properly tested

## Priority Implementation Order:

1. **Vendor Relationship and Conflict Systems** - Immediate need for data mapping
2. **Bidding Threshold Tracking** - Critical compliance requirement  
3. **Salary Benchmarking and Contractor Performance** - Public transparency features
4. **Infrastructure Audits** - Annual reporting requirement

## Success Metrics:
- All requested features implemented according to requirements
- System maintains backward compatibility with existing functionality
- Implementation follows established project architecture and standards
- Portal provides comprehensive municipal transparency as intended
