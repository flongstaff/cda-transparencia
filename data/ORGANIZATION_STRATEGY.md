# Data Organization Strategy (Preserving Your Excellent Work)

## Current Structure Assessment

Your current organization is excellent and should be preserved:

```
data/source_materials/
├── 2017-2025/           # Year-based organization (perfect for temporal analysis)
├── thematic_dirs/       # Topic-based organization (great for subject matter focus)
│   ├── budgets/         # Budget documents
│   ├── declarations/    # Property declarations
│   ├── Licitaciones/    # Public tenders
│   ├── Salarios-DDJ/    # Salaries and declarations
│   ├── reports/        # General reports
│   ├── financial_data/ # Financial information
│   ├── web_archives/   # Archived data
│   ├── ley/            # Laws
│   ├── Ordenanzas/     # Ordinances
│   ├── decretos/       # Decrees
│   └── ...             # Other thematic directories
```

## Enhancement Strategy (Safe, Non-Disruptive)

### 1. Documentation Addition (No File Movement)
Create README.md files in each directory explaining:
- What type of documents are contained
- Date range of documents
- Source of documents
- Update frequency

### 2. Metadata Creation (No File Movement)
Create metadata files that track:
- Document provenance
- Hashes for integrity verification
- Document types and classifications
- Cross-references between related documents

### 3. Index Creation (No File Movement)
Create a master index that:
- Maps documents to years and topics
- Tracks document sources and authenticity
- Links related documents together
- Provides search and navigation aids

## GitHub Repository Strategy

### What to Include in Repository (Small Files)
1. **Directory structure** (your excellent organization)
2. **Documentation files** (README.md, this file, etc.)
3. **Small representative samples** (small PDFs, text files)
4. **Scripts and code** (automation tools)
5. **Metadata files** (indexes, provenance tracking)

### What to Link Externally (Large Files)
1. **Large PDF documents** (>10MB)
2. **High-resolution images**
3. **Video files**
4. **Database dumps**
5. **Archive files**

### External Storage Strategy
1. **Cold storage links** for permanent archival
2. **Cloud storage links** for easy access
3. **Web Archive links** for official document backup
4. **Direct government portal links** for official sources

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Documentation (Safe)
Create README.md files explaining your structure without moving anything

### Phase 2: Metadata (Safe)
Add metadata files tracking document provenance without moving anything

### Phase 3: Indexing (Safe)
Create searchable indexes without moving anything

### Phase 4: Repository Preparation
Decide what goes in repository vs. external links

## Your Structure Preservation

Your current organization is:
- ✅ **Chronologically logical** (2017-2025)
- ✅ **Thematically coherent** (budgets, declarations, etc.)
- ✅ **Source-aware** (web_archives clearly separated)
- ✅ **Legal-compliant** (laws, ordinances, decrees separated)
- ✅ **Professional** (consistent naming, clear hierarchy)

This structure should be preserved exactly as-is. Our enhancement will add value through documentation and metadata without changing your excellent organization.
