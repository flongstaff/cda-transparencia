# Current Data Organization Assessment

## What's Already Well Organized

### 1. Year-Based Directory Structure
The data is already organized by years (2018-2025) which is excellent for:
- Easy temporal navigation
- Historical data comparison
- Year-over-year analysis

### 2. Thematic Directories
Several thematic directories exist:
- `budgets/` - Budget documents
- `declarations/` - Property declarations
- `tenders/` - Public tenders
- `financial_data/` - Financial reports
- `reports/` - General reports
- `web_archives/` - Archived data

### 3. Document Naming
Many documents already follow descriptive naming conventions:
- `ddjj-2022.pdf` - Property declaration for 2022
- `PRESUPUESTO-2025-APROBADO-ORD-3280-24.pdf` - Approved 2025 budget

## Recommended Next Steps

### 1. Run Existing Organization Scripts
The project already has scripts that can help with further organization:

```bash
# Navigate to project root
cd /Users/flong/Developer/cda-transparencia

# Run the material organization script
./scripts/organize_materials.sh

# Clean up duplicates
./scripts/cleanup_duplicates.sh

# Consolidate directories
./scripts/consolidate_directories.sh
```

### 2. Focus on Data Quality Rather Than Reorganization
Since you've already organized by year and themes, let's focus on:

#### A. Document Verification
- Verify document authenticity and provenance
- Check for broken or corrupted files
- Remove duplicates

#### B. Metadata Enhancement
- Add README.md files to explain each directory
- Document the source of each document
- Record document hashes for integrity verification

#### C. Web Archive Integration
- Identify critical documents for archiving
- Set up automated archiving processes
- Document archive locations

### 3. GitHub Repository Optimization

#### File Selection for Repository
Keep in GitHub:
- Organized directory structure
- Key documentation files
- Small representative samples
- Scripts and code

Link externally for large files:
- Large PDF documents
- High-resolution images
- Video files
- Database dumps

#### Repository Structure Recommendation

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Assessment (Today)
1. Run existing organization scripts
2. Review current structure
3. Identify gaps
4. Document current state

### Phase 2: Enhancement (Tomorrow)
1. Add documentation to directories
2. Verify document authenticity
3. Remove duplicates
4. Create metadata files

### Phase 3: GitHub Optimization (Soon)
1. Select files for repository inclusion
2. Create external links for large files
3. Set up Git LFS for essential large files
4. Finalize repository structure

## Success Metrics

### Organization Goals
- Maintain your existing good organization
- Add documentation to explain the structure
- Verify all documents have clear provenance
- Remove duplicates and broken files

### Repository Goals
- Keep repository size manageable (< 1GB)
- Make navigation intuitive
- Ensure all files have clear documentation
- Make repository suitable for collaboration

### Data Quality Goals
- Verify authenticity of 90% of included documents
- Document provenance for 100% of included documents
- Remove or fix 95% of broken links
- Create metadata for key documents

Your current organization is already quite good. Let's build on what you've accomplished rather than reorganize everything.
