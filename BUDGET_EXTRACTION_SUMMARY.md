# Budget Data Extraction and Analysis Results

## Summary

We have successfully extracted and parsed budget execution data from the PDF document:
`/Users/flong/Developer/cda-transparencia/data/pdfs/ESTADO-DE-EJECUCION-DE-GASTOS-1.pdf`

### Key Findings:

- **Period Covered**: April 1, 2022 to June 30, 2022 (Second Quarter)
- **Year**: 2022
- **Total Budgeted Amount**: ARS 612,017,446.00 (~612 million Argentine Pesos)
- **Total Executed Amount**: ARS 286,739,436.64 (~286 million Argentine Pesos)
- **Overall Execution Rate**: 46.85%
- **Items Processed**: 1,841 individual budget items

### Top Budget Categories:

1. **Personal Obrero**: ARS 21,345,978.08 (23.41% execution rate)
2. **Transferencias a instituciones de**: ARS 15,000,000.00 (12.92% execution rate)
3. **Personal Jerárquico**: ARS 14,721,326.56 (20.19% execution rate)
4. **Horas extras**: ARS 12,555,002.16 (32.05% execution rate)
5. **Personal Superior**: ARS 12,403,515.67 (15.45% execution rate)

## Technical Details

### Extraction Methodology:
1. Used `pdfplumber` to extract text from the PDF file
2. Developed a custom parser to identify budget items with their codes, descriptions, and financial figures
3. Organized data into structured JSON format for easier querying and analysis

### Data Fields Extracted:
- **Code**: Hierarchical budget item code (e.g., 1.1.1.1)
- **Name**: Description of the budget item
- **Budgeted**: Approved budget amount (in ARS)
- **Executed**: Amount actually spent (in ARS)
- **Paid**: Amount actually paid (in ARS)
- **Unpaid**: Amount executed but not yet paid (in ARS)
- **Execution Rate**: Percentage of budget that has been executed (0-100%)

## Potential Applications

### Transparency Portal Enhancement:
1. **Budget Dashboard**: Visualize execution rates by category
2. **Budget Item Search**: Allow citizens to search for specific budget items
3. **Historical Comparison**: Compare execution rates over time
4. **Category Breakdown**: Show spending by major categories (personnel, goods, services)
5. **Alert System**: Notify users when spending exceeds certain thresholds

### Analysis Opportunities:
1. **Spending Efficiency**: Identify categories with low execution rates
2. **Seasonal Patterns**: Analyze spending patterns throughout the year
3. **Budget Accuracy**: Compare approved vs. actual spending
4. **Priority Assessment**: Determine which areas are receiving the most funding

## Next Steps

### Data Enrichment:
1. Extract data from additional budget execution PDFs
2. Parse revenue/budget source documents
3. Include debt and investment data
4. Cross-reference with salary and personnel data

### Portal Integration:
1. Create API endpoints to serve this structured data
2. Develop frontend components to visualize the budget data
3. Implement search and filtering functionality
4. Add export features (CSV, PDF reports)

### Further Automation:
1. Implement automated PDF extraction for newly published documents
2. Set up scheduled data processing pipeline
3. Create data validation and anomaly detection mechanisms
4. Establish data archival and backup procedures
