ALTER TABLE property_declarations ADD COLUMN source_id INTEGER;
ALTER TABLE property_declarations ADD COLUMN lawful_to_publish BOOLEAN;
ALTER TABLE property_declarations ADD COLUMN redaction_reason TEXT;

-- Create sources table
CREATE TABLE sources (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(255),
  url TEXT,
  last_scraped TIMESTAMP,
  reliability_score DECIMAL(3,2)
);
```

### 2. **API Endpoint Enhancement**
```javascript
// Add versioning
app.use('/api/v1', apiRoutes);

// Add provenance headers
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  res.setHeader('X-Data-Provenance', 'source-tracking-enabled');
  next();
});

// Standardized error handling
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  res.status(err.status || 500).json({
    type: 'https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc9457',
    title: 'An error occurred',
    status: err.status || 500,
    detail: err.message
  });
});
```

### 3. **Frontend Enhancement**
```typescript
// Migrate to React Query
import { useQuery } from '@tanstack/react-query';

const { data, isLoading, error } = useQuery({
  queryKey: ['declarations', year],
  queryFn: () => apiService.getPropertyDeclarations(year)
});

// Add i18n enhancement
import { useTranslation } from 'react-i18next';
const { t, i18n } = useTranslation();
```
