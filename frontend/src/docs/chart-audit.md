# Chart Implementation Audit

## Current Pattern (Recommended)
All chart components should follow this pattern:

1. Use ErrorBoundary wrapper around charts
2. Use consistent ChartContainer component for styling
3. Use proper loading states
4. Use proper error handling with user-friendly messages
5. Use responsive design with proper height/width settings
6. Use consistent data loading through hooks

## Page-by-Page Audit

### InvestmentsPage ❌

### Salaries Page ✓

## Recommendations

1. Update InvestmentsPage to include charts using the same pattern as other pages
2. Ensure all new chart components follow the established pattern
3. Add mock data for testing when real data is not available
4. Implement proper error boundaries for all chart components
5. Use consistent styling with ChartContainer component
