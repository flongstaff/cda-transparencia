# Phase 1: Enhanced Search with Natural Language Processing Research

## Objective
Implement semantic search capabilities that allow natural language queries while maintaining transparency about AI usage, following the implementation plan for the Carmen de Areco Transparency Portal.

## Technology Stack Research

### NLP Libraries for Spanish Language Processing
Based on the implementation plan requirements, we need to evaluate suitable NLP libraries that can run client-side or in a secure backend environment:

#### Option 1: spaCy with Spanish Language Model
- **Pros**: Excellent Spanish language support, can run client-side with spaCy.js, robust linguistic features
- **Cons**: Larger bundle size, requires model hosting
- **Licensing**: MIT
- **Implementation**: Use Spanish language model (es_core_news_sm) for tokenization and similarity matching

#### Option 2: Transformers.js with Spanish Models
- **Pros**: Can run client-side, good for semantic search, supports Spanish models
- **Cons**: Requires downloading model weights, may impact performance
- **Licensing**: Apache 2.0
- **Implementation**: Use pre-trained Spanish BERT models for semantic similarity

#### Option 3: Elasticsearch with Spanish Analysis
- **Pros**: Production-ready, excellent search features, good performance
- **Cons**: Requires server component, more complex setup
- **Licensing**: SSPL (source-available)
- **Implementation**: Configure with Spanish language analyzers

#### Option 4: Algolia or Similar Search Service
- **Pros**: Professional-grade search, good NLP features, handles scaling
- **Cons**: Requires external service, potential cost, data privacy considerations
- **Licensing**: Commercial
- **Implementation**: API integration with proper privacy controls

### Vector Search Implementation
For semantic search capabilities, we need to implement vector search:

#### Option 1: HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World)
- **Pros**: High performance, good accuracy, efficient for similarity search
- **Cons**: Complex implementation, requires maintenance
- **Implementation**: Use libraries like hnswlib

#### Option 2: Approximate Nearest Neighbor Libraries
- **Pros**: Various options available, good performance
- **Cons**: Learning curve, parameter tuning
- **Implementation**: faiss, nmslib, or similar

### Privacy-Preserving Architecture
Following the implementation plan's privacy-by-design approach:

1. **No Query Logging**: Ensure user queries are never stored
2. **Client-Side Processing**: Where possible, process queries in the user's browser
3. **Query Anonymization**: If server-side processing is needed, queries must be ephemeral
4. **Data Minimization**: Only process the minimum necessary data

## Recommended Approach for Phase 1

Based on the implementation plan's requirements for privacy preservation and transparency, I recommend:

1. **Initial Implementation**: Start with Elasticsearch approach for immediate functionality
2. **Spanish Language Support**: Configure with Spanish language analyzers
3. **Privacy Features**: Implement query anonymization and no-logging policy
4. **Transparency Layer**: Add clear indicators when AI-powered search is used
5. **Explainability**: Show how results were ranked

## Next Steps

1. Create the Elasticsearch configuration with Spanish language support
2. Implement basic semantic search functionality
3. Add privacy-preserving features
4. Create UI indicators for AI usage
5. Implement result explanation features
6. Test with actual municipal data
