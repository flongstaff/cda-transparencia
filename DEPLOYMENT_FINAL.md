## What Happened

- ❌ **Cloudflare Pages** - Had persistent build configuration issues
- ✅ **GitHub Pages** - Working perfectly, deployed successfully

## Deployment Details

- **Method:** GitHub Pages (automatic via gh-pages branch)
- **Deploy time:** ~30 seconds
- **Command:** `cd frontend && npm run deploy`
- **Workflow:** pages-build-deployment (automatic)

## Monitoring

```bash

## Recommendation for Cloudflare

Delete the Cloudflare Pages project to avoid confusion:
1. Go to: https://dash.cloudflare.com → Workers & Pages → cda-transparencia
2. Settings → Delete project

DNS will stay with Cloudflare, but deployment is GitHub Pages.
